</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>After the suggestion from a member of this community (I don't want to
nominate him because I don't want to influence anyone) I've decided to
candidate myself for the Maemo Council. Here I'm! You can read something
about me and about my motivations in the rest of this post.</p>
<p><em>Name:</em> <strong>Andrea Grandi</strong><br>
<em><a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo.org</a>:</em> <strong>Andy80</strong> -
<a href="http://maemo.org/profile/view/andy80/">http://maemo.org/profile/view/andy80/</a><br>
<em>Corporate affiliation:</em> none</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> My name is Andrea Grandi, I'm 28 and I live in Pistoia
(Tuscany, ITALY). I'm a programmer, in particular very interested in
Linux and opensource. I've been working for some years as computer
programmer, then I decided to begin studing at university, and currently
I'm attending at "Universit√† degli studi di Firenze" to get the Computer
Science degree. I spend lot of my time to manage the Pistoia Linux User
Group I founded in 2001.</p>
<p><strong>My life in the community:</strong> I'm part of the community since I bought
my first Nokia 770. I started contributing to the mailing lists, I wrote
some tutorials (in italian language, then I translated them to english)
and I ported SPIM (a MIPS emulator) to Nokia 770. Later I had the
possibility to buy a N810 and I was able to experiment more with the
Maemo SDK. I was at the Maemo Summit in Berlin, doing a light talk about
Maemo development using Eclipse, PluThon and EsBox plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> I really would like to be able to do more for the
community and one of the best way could be to be part of the council, to
help both users/developers to explain their requests to Nokia and Nokia
to understand the requests from the community. There are a lot of
fantastic ideas comung from the community that could improve what we are
doing: the key is to organize them and giving them more attention. This
is what I've always looked for: working together to build something
great!</p>
